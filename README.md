How to use mathematical functions: type and "=" before your expression, when ready to calculate click enter. 
example: "=2+2" *enter*
result: *4*

Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JS

  
Problems faced/concepts learned:
- this project took some work!
- I got much better at using regex.
- The spreadsheet was entirely constricted with html in js which was also challenging.
- used complex array methods.
